# Six Sigma Yellow Belt Project: Optimizing Appointment Scheduling

This project outlines a Six Sigma Yellow Belt project aimed at improving the appointment scheduling process within a healthcare clinic. The goal is to reduce the number of unfilled appointment slots and increase revenue by analyzing cancellation patterns and optimizing double-booking strategies.

## Project Overview

The project follows the DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) methodology to address the problem of unfilled appointment slots, which leads to lost revenue and potential impacts on patient care.

### Define Phase

* **Problem Statement:** The clinic experiences an average of 15% of appointment slots going unfilled per week, resulting in an estimated \$5,000 in lost weekly revenue.
* **Business Case:** Optimizing appointment scheduling is crucial for maximizing revenue, improving patient access, and enhancing patient satisfaction.
* **Goal Statement:** The project aims to reduce unfilled appointment slots by 50% and increase weekly revenue by \$2,500 within 12 weeks.
* **Project Scope:** The project focuses on the appointment scheduling process, from the patient's initial request to the appointment occurrence, including analyzing historical data, cancellation patterns, and slot utilization.

### Measure Phase

* A data collection plan has been developed to track key metrics such as appointment slot status, cancellation time, cancellation lead time, and patient no-show status.

### Analyze Phase

* The project involves creating a process map of the current appointment scheduling process to identify areas for improvement.
* Formulating null and alternative hypotheses to be tested with the collected data. For example:
    * H0: The proportion of unfilled appointment slots will not decrease after implementing the new scheduling process.
    * Ha: The proportion of unfilled appointment slots will decrease after implementing the new scheduling process.

### Improve Phase

* This phase will involve developing and implementing strategies to reduce unfilled slots, such as a predictive model for cancellations and an optimized double-booking protocol.

### Control Phase

* _(Note: The Control phase is stated as being beyond the scope of the Yellow Belt Capstone)_
